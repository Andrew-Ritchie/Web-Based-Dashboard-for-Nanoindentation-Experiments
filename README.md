# Web-Based Dashboard for Nanoindentation Experiments
Development of an online user-oriented dashboard, allowing users to store, share and analyse results from nanoindentation experiments performed by an atomic force microscope or nanoindenter. 

### Access 
The application is currently deployed at http://euandrewritchie.eu.pythonanywhere.com/, please access it through Google Chrome as you may experience rendering problems on other browsers.

### Documentation
To inspect the supporting documentation please download the "Documentation" folder and open "html/modules.html". This contains details on each function developed within the codebase supporting any future work. Please note that some files within the codebase have only HTML and CSS and do not contain any analysis functions, therefore, these files do not list any functions and can be inspected within the file itself. The "Documentation" folder also contains a user manual outlining how to interact with the developed application.
